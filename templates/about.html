 <h1>Gabrielle Burke</h1>
 <p>Hi, my name is Gabrielle Burke, and I am a finalising Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies.
    My interests include technology and its application in medicine, volunteering, doing personal charity projects, and sports.
    I am interested in Web Development because I view it as a creative outlet for communicating information, needs, and services.
    I also think the process can be fun.</p>
